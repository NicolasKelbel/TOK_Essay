 abstract = {To define power relations as completely asymmetrical is to overlook intercursive power relations in which actors control others in some scopes and are controlled by them in other scopes. In integral power relations, the power holder retains an irreducible authonomy, but his power can be negatively limited in various ways. Power is a narrower concept than social control. It should be limited to intended and successful control of others, although such international control clearly permits greater unintended control as well. When power is defined as a "capacity," it may be either actual or potential. Potential power, however, is not the same thing as merely possible power, which in the case of groups requires social mobilization to become both actual and potential.},

abstract = {The four-colour theorem, that every loopless planar graph admits a vertex-colouring with at most four different colours, was proved in 1976 by Appel and Haken, using a computer. Here we give another proof, still using a computer, but simpler than Appel and Haken's in several respects.}
