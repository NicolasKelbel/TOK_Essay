 abstract = {To define power relations as completely asymmetrical is to overlook intercursive power relations in which actors control others in some scopes and are controlled by them in other scopes. In integral power relations, the power holder retains an irreducible authonomy, but his power can be negatively limited in various ways. Power is a narrower concept than social control. It should be limited to intended and successful control of others, although such international control clearly permits greater unintended control as well. When power is defined as a "capacity," it may be either actual or potential. Potential power, however, is not the same thing as merely possible power, which in the case of groups requires social mobilization to become both actual and potential.},

abstract = {This study addresses one of the most frequently suggested strategies for solving problems in mathematics: drawing a diagram. Professional mathematicians were asked to solve problems and their use of the strategy of drawing diagrams as they attempted to find solutions to these problems was studied. Because particular attention was paid to the reasoning processes of mathematicians while they were actually developing their proofs, the study’s findings suggest ways in which experienced problem solvers used diagrams to perform specific subtasks of proof development, and how diagrams helped them complete the activities. In particular, the study suggests that mathematicians build the visual representation in steps which are clearly separated by a few moments, during which they attempt to analyze the visual representation with respect to the problem situation. This analysis consists of some well-structured processes which involve four types of actions: inferring additional consequences, elaborating on the new mathematical information, stating a new goal, and monitoring their problem-solving process.}

abstract="Explanations and predictions of people's choices, in everyday life as well as in the social sciences, are often founded on the assumption of human rationality. The definition of rationality has been much debated, but there is general agreement that rational choices should satisfy some elementary requirements of consistency and coherence. In this chapter, we describe decision problems in which people systematically violate the requirements of consistency and coherence, and we trace these violations to the psychological principles that govern the perception of decision problems and the evaluation of options.",
